# Limitations of BOLT 11

The BOLT 11 invoice format has proven popular, but has several
limitations:

1. The entangling of bech32 encoding makes it awkward to send
   in other forms (e.g. inside the lightning network itself).
2. The signature applying to the entire invoice makes it impossible
   to prove an invoice without revealing its entirety.
3. Fields cannot generally be extracted for external use: the `h`
   field was a boutique extraction of the `d` field, only.
4. The lack of 'it's OK to be odd' rule makes backwards compatibility
   harder.
5. The 'human-readable' idea of separating amounts proved fraught:
   `p` was often mishandled, and amounts in pico-bitcoin are harder
   than the modern satoshi-based counting.
6. The bech32 encoding was found to have an issue with extensions,
   which means we want to replace or discard it anyway.
7. The `payment_secret` designed to prevent probing by other nodes in
   the path was only useful if the invoice remained private between the
   payer and payee.
8. Invoices must be given per-user, and are actively dangerous if two
   payment attempts are made for the same user.


# Payment Flow Scenarios

Here we use "user" as shorthand for the individual user's lightning
node, and "merchant" as the shorthand for the node of someone who is
selling or has sold something.

There are two basic payment flows supported by BOLT 12:

The general user-pays-merchant flow is:
1. A merchant publishes an *offer* ("send me money"), such as on a web page or a QR code.
2. Every user requests a unique *invoice* over the lightning network
   using an *invoice_request* message.
3. The merchant replies with the *invoice*.
4. The user makes a payment to the merchant indicated by the invoice.

The merchant-pays-user flow (e.g. ATM or refund):
1. The merchant provides a user-specific *offer* ("take my money") in a web page or QR code,
   with an amount (for a refund, also a reference to the to-be-refunded
   invoice).
2. The user sends an *invoice* for the amount in the *offer* (for a
   refund, a proof that they requested the original)
3. The merchant makes a payment to the user indicated by the invoice.

## Payment Proofs and Payer Proofs

Note that the normal lightning "proof of payment" can only demonstrate that an
invoice was paid (by showing the preimage of the `payment_hash`), not who paid
it.  The merchant can claim an invoice was paid, and once revealed, anyone can
claim they paid the invoice, too.[1]

Providing a key in *invoice_request* allows a user to prove that they were the one
to request the invoice.  In addition, the Merkle construction of the BOLT 12
invoice signature allows the user to selectively reveal fields of the invoice
in case of dispute.

# Encoding

Each of the forms documented here are in
[TLV](01-messaging.md#type-length-value-format) format.

The supported ASCII encoding is the human-readable prefix, followed by a
`1`, followed by a bech32-style data string of the TLVs in order,
optionally interspersed with `+` (for indicating additional data is to
come).

## Requirements

Readers of a bolt12 string:
- if it encounters a `+` followed zero or more whitespace characters between 
  two bech32 characters:
  - MUST remove the `+` and whitespace.

## Rationale

The use of bech32 is arbitrary, but already exists in the bitcoin
world.  We currently omit the six-character trailing checksum: QR
codes have their own checksums anyway, and errors don't result in loss
of funds.

The use of `+` (which is ignored) allows use over limited
text fields like Twitter:

```
lno1xxxxxxxx+

yyyyyyyyyyyy+

zzzzz
```

See [format-string-test.json](bolt12/format-string-test.json).

## Signature Calculation

All signatures are created as per
[BIP-340](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0340.mediawiki),
and tagged as recommended there.  Thus we define H(`tag`,`msg`) as
SHA256(SHA256(`tag`) || SHA256(`tag`) || `msg`), and SIG(`tag`,`msg`,`key`)
as the signature of H(`tag`,`msg`) using `key`.

Each form is signed using one or more *signature TLV elements*: TLV
types 240 through 1000.  For these
the tag is "lightning" || `messagename` || `fieldname`, and `msg` is the
Merkle-root; "lightning" is the literal 9-byte ASCII string,
`messagename` is the name of the TLV stream being signed (i.e. "offer", "invoice_request" or "invoice") and the `fieldname` is the TLV field containing the
signature (e.g. "signature" or "refund_signature").

The formulation of the Merkle tree is similar to that proposed in
[BIP-341](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki),
with each TLV leaf paired with a nonce leaf to avoid
revealing adjacent nodes in proofs (assuming there is a non-revealed TLV
which has enough entropy).

The Merkle tree's leaves are, in TLV-ascending order for each tlv:
1. The H("LnLeaf",tlv).
2. The H("LnAll"||all-tlvs,tlv) where "all-tlvs" consists of all non-signature TLV entries appended in ascending order.

The Merkle tree inner nodes are H("LnBranch", lesser-SHA256||greater-SHA256);
this ordering means that proofs are more compact since left/right is
inherently determined.

If there are not exactly a power of 2 leaves, then the tree depth will
be uneven, with the deepest tree on the lowest-order leaves.

e.g. consider the encoding of an `offer` `signature` with TLVs TLV1, TLV2 and TLV3:

```
L1=H("LnLeaf",TLV1)
L1nonce=H("LnAll"||TLV1||TLV2||TLV3,TLV1) 
L2=H("LnLeaf",TLV2)
L2nonce=H("LnAll"||TLV1||TLV2||TLV3,TLV2) 
L3=H("LnLeaf",TLV3)
L3nonce=H("LnAll"||TLV1||TLV2||TLV3,TLV3) 

Assume L1 < L1nonce, L2 > L2nonce and L3 > L3nonce.

   L1    L1nonce                      L2   L2nonce                L3   L3nonce
     \   /                             \   /                       \   /
      v v                               v v                         v v
L1A=H("LnBranch",L1||L1nonce) L2A=H("LnBranch",L2nonce||L2)  L3A=H("LnBranch",L3nonce||L3)
                 
Assume L1A < L2A:

       L1A   L2A                                 L3A=H("LnBranch",L3nonce||L3)
         \   /                                    |
          v v                                     v
  L1A2A=H("LnBranch",L1A||L2A)                   L3A=H("LnBranch",L3nonce||L3)
  
Assume L1A2A > L3A:

  L1A2A=H("LnBranch",L1A||L2A)          L3A
                          \            /
                           v          v
                Root=H("LnBranch",L3A||L1A2A)

Signature = SIG("lightningoffersignature", Root, nodekey)
```

# Offers

Offers are a precursor to an invoice: readers will either request an invoice
(or multiple) or send an invoice based on the offer.  An offer can be much longer-lived than a
particular invoice, so has some different characteristics; in particular it
can be recurring, and the amount can be in a non-lightning currency.  It's
also designed for compactness, to easily fit inside a QR code.

The human-readable prefix for offers is `lno`.

## Requirements For Offers

A writer of an offer:
  - if it sets `node_id`:
    - MUST set `node_id` to the public key of the node to request the invoice from.
  - otherwise:
    - MUST provide at least one `blinded_path`
    - MUST use the final `onionmsg_path` `point` in the first `blinded_path` as the implied `node_id` for `signature`.
  - MAY specify exactly one signature TLV: `signature`:
    - If so, it MUST set `sig` to the signature using `node_id` as described in [Signature Calculation](#signature-calculation).
  - MUST set `description` to a complete description of the purpose
    of the payment.
  - if the chain for the invoice is not solely bitcoin:
    - MUST specify `chains` the offer is valid for.
  - otherwise:
    - MAY omit `chains`, implying that bitcoin is only chain.
  - if a specific minimum `amount` is required for successful payment:
    - MUST set `amount` to the amount expected (per item).
    - if the currency for `amount` is that of the first entry in `chains`:
      - MUST specify `amount` in multiples of the minimum lightning-payable unit
        (e.g. milli-satoshis for bitcoin).
    - otherwise:
      - MUST specify `iso4217` as an ISO 4712 three-letter code.
      - MUST specify `amount` in the currency unit adjusted by the ISO 4712
        exponent (e.g. USD cents).
  - if it supports offer features:
    - SHOULD set `features` to the bitmap of offer features.
  - if the offer expires:
    - MUST set `absolute_expiry` `seconds_from_epoch` to the number of seconds
      after midnight 1 January 1970, UTC that invoice_request should not be
      attempted.
  - if it is connected only by private channels:
    - MUST include `paths` containing one or more paths to the node from
      publicly reachable nodes.
  - otherwise:
    - MAY include `paths`.
  - if it includes `paths`:
    - if the `node_id` is not public:
      - MUST ignore any invoice_request which does not use one of the `paths`.
    - otherwise:
      - MAY ignore any invoice_request which does not use one of the `paths`.
    - MUST NOT blind the first `onionmsg_path` `node_id` point.
  - if it sets `issuer`:
    - SHOULD set it to clearly identify the issuer of the invoice.
    - if it includes a domain name:
      - SHOULD begin it with either user@domain or domain
      - MAY follow with a space and more text
  - if it can supply more than one item for a single invoice
    - if the minimum quantity is more than 1:
      - MUST set that minimum in `quantity_min`
    - if the maximum quantity is known:
      - MUST set that maximum in `quantity_max`
    - if neither:
      - MUST set `quantity_min` to 1 to indicate `quantity` is supported.
    - if both:
      - MUST set `quantity_min` less than or equal to `quantity_max`.
    - MUST NOT set `quantity_min` or `quantity_max` less than 1.
  - if `send_invoice` is present:
    - if the offer is for a partial or full refund for a previously-paid
      invoice:
      - SHOULD set `refunded_payment_hash` to the `payment_hash` of that
        invoice.
  - otherwise:
    - MUST NOT set `refunded_payment_hash`.

A reader of an offer:
  - if `features` contains unknown _odd_ bits that are non-zero:
    - MUST ignore the bit.
  - if `features` contains unknown _even_ bits that are non-zero:
    - MUST NOT respond to the offer.
    - SHOULD indicate the unknown bit to the user.
  - if `description` is not set:
    - MUST NOT respond to the offer.
  - if `node_id` is not set:
    - if `paths` is not set or does not contain at least one `blinded_path`:
      - MUST NOT respond to the offer.
    - MUST use the final `onionmsg_path` `point` in the first `blinded_path` as the `node_id`.
  - if `signature` is present, but is not a valid signature using `node_id` as described in [Signature Calculation](#signature-calculation):
    - MUST NOT respond to the offer.
  - SHOULD gain user consent for recurring payments.
  - SHOULD allow user to view and cancel recurring payments.
  - if it uses `amount` to provide the user with a cost estimate:
    - MUST warn user if amount of actual invoice differs significantly
        from that expectation.
  - SHOULD not respond to an offer if the current time is after
    `absolute_expiry`.
  - if `paths` is set:
    - SHOULD use one or more `paths` to contact the node.
    - MUST start the blinded path from the first `node_id` point	
    - MUST blind the first `node_id` using `blinding`.
  - FIXME: more!

## Rationale

A signature is optional, because it makes for a longer string (potentially
limiting QR code use on low-end cameras); if the offer has an error, no
invoice will be given (or, for `send_invoice` offers, accepted), since
the `offer_id` already covers all the non-signature fields.

The `node_id` is redundant if a `blinded_path` is provided: a public
node can always arrange that the final `node_id` in the path is
unblinded.

A `blinded_path` is used as both a route hint (for a public node), and
for receiver privacy.  The first `node_id` is not blinded, as the
sender must know where the path begins, but it will have to apply the
blinding to that first `node_id` to create a suitable onion.

# Invoice Requests

Invoice Requests are a request for an invoice; the human-readable prefix for
invoices is `lnr`.

## Requirements for Invoice Requests

The writer of an invoice_request:
  - MUST set `payer_key` to a transient public key.
  - MUST remember the secret key corresponding to `payer_key`.
  - MUST set `offer_id` to the Merkle root of the offer as described in [Signature Calculation](#signature-calculation).
  - MUST NOT set or imply any `chain_hash` not set or implied by the offer.
  - MUST set `signature` `sig` as detailed in [Signature Calculation](#signature-calculation) using the `payer_key`.
  - if the offer had a `quantity_min` or `quantity_max` field:
    - MUST set `quantity`
    - MUST set it within that (inclusive) range.
  - otherwise:
    - MUST NOT set `quantity`
  - if the offer did not specify `amount`:
    - MUST specify `amount`.`msat` in multiples of the minimum lightning-payable unit
      (e.g. milli-satoshis for bitcoin) for `chain` (or for bitcoin, if there is no `chain`).
  - otherwise:
    - MAY omit `amount`.
    - if it sets `amount`:
      - MUST specify `amount`.`msat` as greater or equal to amount expected by the offer
        (before any proportional period amount).
  - if the sender has a previous unpaid invoice (for the same offer) which it wants to cancel:
    - MUST set `payer_key` to the same as the previous invoice.
    - MUST set `replace_invoice` to the `payment_hash` or the previous invoice.

The reader of an invoice_request:
  - MUST fail the request if `payer_key` is not present.
  - if `chain` is not present:
    - MUST fail the request if bitcoin is not a supported chain.
  - otherwise:
    - MUST fail the request if `chain` is not a supported chain.
  - MUST fail the request if `features` contains unknown even bits.
  - MUST fail the request if `offer_id` is not present.
  - MUST fail the request if the `offer_id` does not refer to an unexpired offer.
  - MUST fail the request if there is no `signature` field.
  - MUST fail the request if `signature` is not correct.
  - if the offer had a `quantity_min` or `quantity_max` field:
    - MUST fail the request if there is no `quantity` field.
    - MUST fail the request if `quantity` is not within that (inclusive) range.
  - otherwise:
    - MUST fail the request if there is a `quantity` field.
  - if the offer included `amount`:
    - MUST calculate the *base invoice amount* using the offer `amount`:
      - if offer `currency` is not the invoice currency, convert to the
        invoice currency.
      - if request contains `quantity`, multiply by `quantity`.
    - if the request contains `amount`:
      - MUST fail the request if its `amount` is less than the *base invoice amount*.
      - MAY fail the request if its `amount` is much greater than the *base invoice amount*.
      - MUST use the request's `amount` as the *base invoice amount*.
  - otherwise:
    - MUST fail the request if it does not contain `amount`.
    - MUST use the request `amount` as the *base invoice amount*.
  - if the offer has a `replace_invoice`:
    - if the `payment_hash` refers to an unpaid invoice for the same `offer_id` and `payer_key`:
      - MUST immediately expire/remove that unpaid invoice such that it cannot be paid in future.
    - otherwise:
      - MUST fail the request.

## Rationale

`payer_info` might typically contain information about the derivation of the
`payer_key`.  This should not leak any information (such as using a simple
BIP-32 derivation path); a valid system might be for a node to maintain a base
payer key, and encode a 128-bit tweak here.  The payer_key would be derived by
tweaking the base key with SHA256(payer_base_pubkey || tweak).

`payer_note` allows you to compliment, taunt, or otherwise engrave
graffiti into the invoice for all to see.

Users can give a tip (or obscure the amount sent) by specifying an
`amount` in their invoice request, even though the offer specifies an
`amount`.  Obviously this will only be accepted by the recipient if
the invoice request amount exceeds the amount it's expecting (i.e. its
`amount` after any currency conversion, multiplied by `quantity` if
any).  Note that for recurring invoices with `proportional_amount`
set, the `amount` in the invoice request will be scaled by the time in
the period; the sender should not attempt to scale it.

`replace_invoice` allows the mutually-agreed removal of and old unpaid
invoice; this can be used in the case of stuck payments.  If
successful in replacing the stuck invoice, the sender may make a
second payment such that it can prove double-payment should the
receiver still accept the first, delayed payment.

# Invoices

Invoices are a request for payment, and when the payment is made 
it can be combined with the invoice to form a cryptographic receipt.

The human-readable prefix for invoices is `lni`.  It can be sent in
response to an `invoice_request` or an `offer` with `send_invoice`
using `onion_message` `invoice` field.

## Rationale

Because the messaging layer is unreliable, it's quite possible to
receive multiple requests for the same offer.  As it's the caller's
responsibility not to reuse `payer_key` except for recurring invoices,
the writer doesn't have to check all the fields are duplicates before
simply returning a previous invoice.  Note that such caching is optional,
and should be carefully limited when e.g. currency conversion is involved,
or if the invoice has expired.

The invoice duplicates fields rather than committing to the previous offer or
invoice_request.  This flattened format simplifies storage at some space cost, as
the payer need only remember the invoice for any refunds or proof.

The reader of the invoice cannot trust the invoice correctly reflects the
offer and invoice_request fields, hence the requirements to check that they
are correct.

Note that the recipient of the invoice can determine the expected
amount from either the offer it received, or the invoice_request it
sent, so often already has authorization for the expected amount.

It's natural to set the `relative_expiry` of an invoice for a
recurring offer to the end of the payment window for the period, but
if that is a long time and the offer was in another currency, it's
common to cap this at some maximum duration.  For example, omitting it
implies the default of 7200 seconds, which is generally a sufficient
time for payment.

Rather than provide detailed per-hop-payinfo for each hop in every
blinded path, we approximate by assuming they're uniform across each
particular blinded path.  This is simpler, and also avoids trivially
revealing any distinguishing non-uniformity which may distinguish
the path.

It's often useful to provide capacity hints, particularly where more
than one blinded path is included, for payers to use multi-part
payments.

The invoice issuer is allowed to ignore `payer_note` (it has an odd
number, so is optional), but if it does not, it must copy it exactly
as the invoice_request specified.

`desthint` is a compromise, to allow offers to be used with private
channels before blinded payments are implemented everywhere.

# Invoice Errors

Informative errors can be returned in an onion message `invoice_error`
field (via the onion `reply_path`) for either `invoice_request` or
`invoice`.

## TLV Fields for `invoice_error`

1. `tlv_stream`: `invoice_error`
2. types:
    1. type: 1 (`erroneous_field`)
    2. data:
        * [`tu64`:`tlv_fieldnum`]
    1. type: 3 (`suggested_value`)
    2. data:
        * [`...*byte`:`value`]
    1. type: 5 (`error`)
    2. data:
        * [`...*utf8`:`msg`]

## Requirements

A writer of an invoice_error:
  - MUST set `error` to an explanatory string.
  - MAY set `erroneous_field` to a specific field number in the
    `invoice` or `invoice_request` which had a problem.
  - if it sets `erroneous_field`:
    - MAY set `suggested_value`.
    - if it sets `suggested_value`:
      - MUST set `suggested_value` to a valid field for that `tlv_fieldnum`.
  - otherwise:
    - MUST NOT set `suggested_value`.

A reader of an invoice_error:
   FIXME!

## Rationale

Usually an error message is sufficient for diagnostics, however there
is at least one case where it should be programatically parsable.  A
recurring offer which sets `send_invoice` can also specify a currency,
which opens the possibility for a disagreement on exchange rate.  In
this case, the `suggested_value` reflects its expected value, and the
sender can send a new invoice.

# FIXME: Possible future extensions:

1. The offer can require delivery info in the `invoice_request`.
2. An offer can be updated: the response to an `invoice_request` is another offer,
   perhaps with a signature from the original `node_id`
3. Any empty TLV fields can mean the value is supposed to be known by
   other means (i.e. transport-specific), but is still hashed for sig.
4. We could upgrade to allow multiple offers in one invoice_request and
   invoice, to make a shopping list.
7. All-zero offer_id == gratuitous payment.
8. Streaming invoices?
